## Project information

This project is a web client that shows the available tables and its content from a crateDB database.
It consist in a frontend done with [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom), generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Styling is done with vanilla CSS.

## How to run

You would need to run cratedb via docker using this command

### `docker run -p "4200:4200" crate -Chttp.cors.enabled=true -Chttp.cors.allow-origin="*"`

Additionally there is a `initdb.sql` file with some code to create tables and insert data in case your database is empty. For this you will need to open the database UI panel [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

for more information check [the official documentation](https://crate.io/docs/crate/tutorials/en/latest/getting-started/install-run/special/docker.html)

and run the client with the following commands:

### `cd client`
### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
